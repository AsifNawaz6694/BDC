                        <h2>Where innovation gets funded</h2>
                        <p>There is a plethora of great ideas that will never make it to the marketplace. Most people
                            with these ideas think that it is because of lack of funding, but in reality it is a
                            combination of things. Funders donâ€™t buy ideas. They fund people. </p>
                        <p>Big Dream Capital has created a platform for innovation viability in the market. We will
                            guide you through a short process to be ready for funding help. This process will enhance
                            and refine your innovation so that potential funders can easily understand what it is, and
                            who you are. We will design a game plan so that you will know how the funds will be
                            distributed to position your innovation for success. And last, if needed, we will
                            professionally pitch for you, the innovation to the funders.</p>
